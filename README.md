# wnghub

### 'what's new on github'

### How to use:
- Installation (only tested Python 3.7+): `pip3 install git+https://github.com/brighton1101/wnghub.git@0.0.2`
- Run it! `wnghub` for unread notifications, `wnghub -A` to include read notifications

### Configurable options:
Note that these are all stored to a local config file on your machine. That way, you can set defaults and have these filters pre-applied without having to type out additional info.

#### Exclude or include notifications by:
- repo name
- org name
- notification reason
- type: (pr or issue)

#### And:
- number of results to show
- whether or not to show notifications that are already read
- only show participating

### Example:
```sh
ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ ~ $ wnghub set-auth <auth token here> # set auth token

ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ ~ $ wnghub # Run with set configuration (i don't have any unread notifications...)
No new matching notifications!

ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ ~ $ wnghub -A # shows 'all' notifications (even those that are read)

### Setting up dev environment:
- Prerequisite: Have Python 3.7+ installed
- Clone repo
- Create virtual environment by running the following from the root of the repo: `python3 -m venv venv`
- Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install package by doing the following: `pip3 install -e .` from root of repo
- Install dev and testing requirements: `pip3 install -r dev-requirements.txt`
- Run `pytest` and ensure all tests are passing
- Install pre-commit: `pre-commit install`
- If everything looks good, you should be good to go
- To exit virtual environment, run `deactivate`. When you want to enter virtual environment again, navigate to root of repo and repeat the same command from above: `source venv/bin/activate`
